# PlantsVsZombie

This is a University project done during the Programming Techniques course during my Erasmus in Madrid.

It consists of a "replica" of the famous plant vs zombie game programmed in Java.

The goal was to understand how encapsulation and inheritance work. Implementing child classes and abstract classes.
